# Economics, complexity theory and systemic redundancy

The first four pages of what follows, is my attempt at describing what a complex system is, in relation to an economy.  Following that is a discussion of one property of complex systems, redundancy, as applied to an economy.  Where I use the term ‘economy’, I am generally referring to the economy of a nation.  I am not an economist, nor am I even particularly well read on the subject of economics.  I would best describe myself as an amateur computational neuro-psychologist, if anything, and this has led to me learning about complex systems and how they operate.  An economy is characterised as a system, both by its complexity and also, I suggest, by the tight coupling between the complex system that is the human, aggregated across all humans that interface with the economy, and the complex system that is the economy itself.

 

The field of economics may be considered intuitively to be complex, but although an economy is certainly a complex thing, best characterised as a continuously changing dynamic, complex system, the application of complex systems theory to economics is comparatively novel.

All the standard theories of economics are defined, with varying degrees of mathematical approximation, describing linear or non-linear relationships, occasionally finding terms that can capture at least some of the dynamic nature of an economy; terms like equilibrium for example, and in some cases reaching into relationships that can’t be described with mathematical formalisms, such as the results of the recently fashionable empirical studies of micro-economics ([https://www.bruegel.org/blog-post/empirical-shift-economics](https://www.bruegel.org/blog-post/empirical-shift-economics)).

This is probably a consequence of the fact that it is not until relatively recently that complexity theory was enunciated, most work starting after the [1970s]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory#History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory#History)), with examples stretching back to the early 1940s [Warren Weaver]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity#Overview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity#Overview:~:text=External%20links-,Overview,-%5Bedit%5D)) and perhaps earlier.

I conceive of a complex system as having a number of features, one of which is that it is relatively impenetrable to description in the linear (or nonlinear) terms of mathematics.  This presents a difficulty in that language, which is a linear system, has to present a structural expectation of cause and effect derived from the grammar itself.  I suggest that attempting to use language, a linear system with this implicit causal relationship, to describe a complex system, in which no linear, contiguous cause and effect relationship, and in which subsymbolic activity is the norm, is to attempt to shoehorn two incongruent forms together.

Perhaps, with enough discussion of complex systems, over a long enough period of time, language will grow the nouns, adjectives, verbs, and metaphorical structure capable of describing complexity more efficiently than it can do so currently.  But for now, one can describe features of a complex economy, but to single out some process or other that is part of a complex system, is to lose the aspect of complexity, which is a holistic, macro process, rather than the sum of constituent micro processes.  I am sure that anyone working with complex systems knows intuitively what a complex system is, but each of them would derive a different description when asked to describe complex systems in general.  Perhaps a school of thought needs to emerge, with some manifesto that delineates precisely the term ‘complex system’.  For now, I shall present what I think is constituted by a complex system, with particular reference to the economy.

Complex systems are often most amenable to description using the terms from dynamic systems theory.  In an economy, the amount of variables that are interacting at any given moment are huge, and none of the variables are capable of being described as representing a ‘state’ of the system, as any state of the system is the set of all the parts of that system in flux, so to single out some individual state, represented by all of the parts of the system, is to demarcate something that is entirely idiosyncratic, and unlikely to repeat.  In an economy, one is describing the aggregated activity of all of the agents in that economy, which despite encompassing companies and other devices, almost certainly boils down to an analysis of humans, and thus human brains, which are complex, subsymbolic systems themselves.

Because of this difficulty in applying any linear analytical decomposition to achieve a simpler description, it tends to be the case that gross, overarching idiomatic descriptions are more powerful in their capacity to meaningfully describe the process of a complex system.  This becomes more obvious when one examines idioms in any language.  In general, language is subject to the aggregative consequence of the cognitive economy of individuals.  This leaves words, composed of phonemic movements, reducing in their extent over time, naturally leading to shorter words through a process of selective ellipsis.  This is not necessarily the case when the language is curated to any degree.  19th century English, for example, demonstrates a proliferation of long and complex terms in normal usage, whilst the language generally, has tended to become less complex with less careful curation, I suggest.

To return to my point, phrases that are capable of elision, will, in their repetition, eventually be represented as words due in part to aggregative cognitive economy and in part to a need to achieve the utility of labelling some large phenomenon with a shorter descriptive unit.  Idioms are phrases that will lose their utility if ellipted or labelled, and so they remain as phrases instead of being shortened down to single words.  If one examines idioms, they are often describing the activities of complex systems. Perhaps it is the case that descriptions of complex systems are not capable of being reduced in that natural process of elision, because complex systems are not meaningfully describable in non complex, discrete terms.

Other features of complex systems that stand out are characterised by the terms robustness, modularity and diversity. Kharrazi et al (2020) define these parts of a complex system, in their assessment of sustainability, a watchword in contemporary economics as well as other scientific disciplines.  A complex system has a high level of robustness to varying circumstances.  It has a modular layout of its parts, such that if one part fails, others will not be mortally affected.  For a similar reason, its parts are often diversely heterogeneous.

The Santa Fe Institute brought together a diversity of theorists from economics and computer science and mathematics, in a symposium in the late 1980s, and have remained a guiding influence in the modern study of economics and complexity study, publishing their findings roughly every decade.  In that first published work, a common feature of studies was chaos theory, a type of non-linear mathematics where the output of some equation is never repeated, and where the output of that system cannot be deterministically derived from its initial conditions, popularised in the 1970s.  Chaos theory, though, is not equivalent to complexity.  Later analyses, published in their recordings of the symposia from 1997, 2005, 2019 (in references), describe the application of different techniques of describing complex systems ranging from computational modelling to the application of epidemiological models to economics.  A reading of the Santa Fe Institute website provides another feature of complex systems - the emergence of novel unpredicted behaviour, although I will not delve too deeply into that interesting topic here.

In the context of economic agents in a complexity based analysis of economics, Arthur et al (Arthur, Durlauf and Lane, introduction to 'the economy of a complex evolving system 2' - 1997) note that expectations in the market become endogenous (derived from no external/super-ordinate cause) as traders continually change and adapt to a market that they create together, part of a discussion of traders who speculate and test speculation through investment.  In the same introduction, the authors point out six features of the economy:

* Dispersed interaction (heterogeneous agents acting in parallel)
* No global controller
* Cross cutting hierarchical organisation
* Continual adaptation
* Perpetual novelty
* Out of equilibrium dynamics

I am currently working on a brief book to describe the physiological correlates of ‘mind’, and can note that these six features can certainly be applied to the central nervous system as a complex system.  National economies are not neural systems, but as complex systems they are remarkably similar.  Both are complex systems with emergent properties that occur as a consequence of more than the sum of their parts, both have drives in one direction or another that follow temporary directions in accordance with the aggregated direction of one more influential group of their constituent parts (whether it is neurons in the case of a neural system or humans in the case of an economy), both have parts that engage in some behaviour when influenced by other parts, and both are entirely reliant on the availability of redundancy for them to be said to be ‘healthy’, a point I will touch upon later.

The terms ‘distal’ and ‘proximal’ are useful when considering complex systems, in terms of both causes and effects.  Distal can be taken to mean distant, although it might be located next to something physically, it can be a distal cause, in that a great amount of time or a great number of intervening variables can occur between its occurrence and the operation of the antecedent part.  This is how I take the term in the context of this essay.  Proximal, is similar, in that it might be distantly located from some antecedent or subsequent event or process, but whatever dimension that we are discussing has little in the way of intervening parts before its influence is felt on that other.

Though non complex economic theories utilise terms like equilibrium, a reference to the fact that they are describing a complex, dynamic system, they also gloss over complexity by accepting simplistic models of the individuals within an economy.  In chapter 9 ‘Minds and Markets’ of the book ‘Being there’, Professor Andy Clark, describes this in a discussion of ‘substantive rationality’ - where the model of the agent within the economic system is a very limited precis of an agent, and one that is not a model of any real thing, since agents in an economy tend to be both heterogeneous and irrational; they don’t follow any easily predictable pattern.  Even though this unreal modelling of the behaviour of individuals in an economy should not lead to a system that is capable of making useful observations about a real economy, it seems that the constraints placed on the agents by an economic system that is derived, at least in part, from the theory that is based on this ‘substantive rationality’ perform in some way that has predictive utility.  In fact, in one reported study, replacing the substantively rational agents with real humans only increased the efficiency of the studied system by 1% (Clark, 1997, pg 184).  It is observed, though, that the utility of the agents within that system is caused in some proximal manner, by the system itself.

So, simple linear theories can be observed to have utility, even though they can constrain their parts to operate in accordance with the way that their systems do so.  But they are often not macro theories, and they are not perfectly approximate to the reality that is a complex system.  I suppose that even a simple linear description can be thought of as a complex dynamic process, but as one that is massively constrained, to the point at which it cannot arrive at novel states that are emergent in unpredictable ways from the interaction of its components, or its initial conditions.  And as described on the Santa Fe website, novel states that are emergent in an unpredictable way from the interaction of its components is another feature of what I might mean when describing a complex system.  Simple descriptions of economics often acknowledge this reality by dealing in percentages, accepting variance, leaving the economist as more gambler, or perhaps statistician, than mathematician.

This fact may be isomorphic with the way that economists trained in classical models of economics do not generally make fundamental changes to the conditions under which an economy operates.  Instead, small changes are made, such as the manipulation of interest rates in one direction or another.   This change is effected with a rationalisation drawn from one classical economic theory or other, but which may be more effectively described in terms of its capacity to solve the problem of local minima in the gradient of descent<sup>1</sup>, as the economy as a whole is tending towards some state or other, prevented by some interceding local minima.

The economy is a complex system, as I argue here, and one of the consequent features of its complexity is that it is unpredictable.  If that weren’t the case, then it would collapse almost immediately, so we should be grateful.  With machine learning being focused towards the economy, where machine learning, particularly large learning models, is extremely adept at deriving patterns with high predictive utility, so we might yet see the economy predicted in some way that might lead to collapse, which will occur due to the consequent lack of redundancy available, a factor I discuss below in more detail.  With regards to the complexity of the economy, any entrenched power, in terms of its wealth, and preserving it, is faced with a situation where the only common sense course of action, as far as it is concerned, is to pursue the status quo.  This further reinforces the preference by economists for small movements, if only to keep their job, if not because radical change has those distal, hidden consequences, and which can feedback negatively.  Causal feedback is another property of complex systems, one which I don’t describe here. 

So a complex system is diverse, modular, and has ‘emergent’ properties that are novel, and non-amenable to analysis in terms of cause and effect relationships between microeconomic factors.  It is not able to be characterised by a linear analysis; even language is incapable of describing it in any complete way, that is capable of capturing the dynamic processes and emergent consequences of a complex system.  General descriptions, idiomatic phrases, are better able to present meaningful descriptions, than complicated sets of linear phrases.  A complex system is one that is robust, and redundancy can be thought of as part of that robustness.

Redundancy

In this essay, I focus on one particular aspect of complex systems, which is the existence and utility of redundancy, seeking to characterise economic health in terms of that property of the economy.  I often use the term ‘systemic redundancy’ when discussing it in relation to the economy, in order to prevent the incorrect assumption that I am discussing the laying off of people from their jobs.  Systemic redundancy, which I will mostly refer to simply as redundancy from hereon, is equivalent to ‘spare room to operate’.

Consider the problem of the tower of Hanoi[^1].  One can see that the problem would not be solvable without the centre pole.  That centre pole is a simple example of redundancy.  It offers the individual a place to store some things, and in this case according to a set system of rules.  That’s about it, quite simply put, redundancy is spare room to move.  You have probably heard the term before, as it occurs in a number of places.  Redundancy as applied to employment status, ‘to be made redundant’, is to become superfluous due to some change in business systems or similar.  One loses one’s job and joins the labour pool where that labour pool is a redundant resource, the systemic redundancy, perhaps, of the labour market.  However, systemic redundancy is a little more complicated than simply ‘spare resources’, it is an important property of complex systems, one that can render a system more robust.  In fact without redundancy available, I suggest a system can be considered to be ‘unhealthy’.

Another form of redundancy, linguistic redundancy, is often considered to be a grammatical error, one in which someone unnecessarily redefines some part of speech, more than once ( ‘more than once’ here is a redundancy).  When something is redundant, it is not serving any purpose, currently, and can be removed without affecting the global state of the system, i.e. the meaning of the sentence, for example, with reference to language.  In fact, when a person is speaking, and they issue the utterance ‘erm’, that is also considered a redundancy, offering the speaker the opportunity to pause and contemplate what they are saying, as they say it, potentially leveraging that redundant moment to reorganise the speech they are to present.  The human language production system has redundancy built into it at every turn, with the neural energy of planned speech effector movements being dissipated when they are initiated but not necessary to incorporate in the final speech act, I suggest. 

When the functioning of the central nervous system is examined, a complex dynamic system, then the availability of fat reserves that can be drawn upon in case of sudden prolonged effort for the purpose of metabolism, is one example of redundancy.  Another one, which I also consider in my work on consciousness, is that when we are happy or relaxed, we are in a state in which there is an abundance of neural redundancy; it is when someone’s neural system lacks redundancy, that the individual experiences poor mental health.  Happiness, I suggest, can be described as a surplus of available resources, i.e. a high level of systemic redundancy.

Each human agent in an economy has their own systemic redundancy, and their relationship to it is not simple, either.  For example, often, if a person has low levels of systemic redundancy, then an evolutionary prerogative kicks in and they start to hunt down and consume resources relatively continuously, mania is one manifestation of this, I suggest.  An economy probably does the same, perhaps as a consequence of the aggregation of that individual behaviour, possibly even describable as a fractal - a form that repeats its shape at smaller or greater points of view.

An economy, as a complex system, has redundancy in the form of the availability of spare financial resources, with which it can address the demands of the current environment that it faces.  However, the total availability of redundancy in an economy can be thought of as more than just spare resources in some grosse way, whether it is spare cash, or perhaps some labour pool.  One of the features of an economy is that it is made of components that operate at the sub-symbolic level, with regards to observably discrete states of the economy (which can only ever be ‘snapshots’ as the economy is a dynamic system).  So redundancy can be thought of as the total whole of some aggregation of its smaller, sub ‘symbolic’ parts.  

When one observes the economic health derivable from exports outstripping imports, one is making a statement about economic redundancy.  Redundancy, though, is more than just the ratio of exports to imports, more than just spare resources.  Redundancy can be derived from the process of economic exchange, and also from the structural arrangement of the economy.

Events that impinge on the amount of available redundancy, reduce the health of the economy.  I suggest that this is one of the principal causes of several global economic collapses.  An interesting example might be the global economic collapse of the early 1990s, which may have been consequent, at least in part, to the introduction of several technologies that increased the speed of financial transactions, ranging from credit and debit cards and the uptake of cash dispensers, to the introduction of push dialling phones.  The sudden increase of speed of financial transaction too suddenly ate into the availability of systemic redundancy, leaving the economy brittle and susceptible to collapse due to other factors.

That is a putative and relatively simple example.  Another, more complicated possibility might be the way in which the economic ecosystem has been massively affected by the sudden introduction of non-complex infrastructure products, such as software, or the streaming of movies, amongst other ‘abstract products’.

For the entire history of economies until the twentieth century, the products in that economy were ‘complex products’ as opposed to ‘abstract products’.  If I were to order a chair, the ecosystem of goods and services generated by my order would be entirely complex.  The wood cutter, the axe maker, the carpenter, and the various toolmakers that support the carpenter, as well as the same relationship concerning the fabric producer, the dye maker, nail manufacturer, upholsterer, furniture salesman, delivery driver, all make part of what is an entirely complex ecosystem supported by that one sale.

Most transactions in the economy were like this, but when computer software began to become a serious commodity in the late 1980s and early 1990s and onwards, a product was created that could be made once, supporting, perhaps, some set of programmers, managers, lawyers, and other administration staff, but once made, the product could simply be copied.  No complex infrastructure was supported beyond that point, except perhaps the packaging and delivery staff, and when that was lost as the internet occurred, the sudden introduction of a non complex, abstract product on the scale of software, created such a money for nothing profit that suddenly the global economy was without systemic redundancy to such a tune that it collapsed repeatedly.

Software was not the only abstract product.  Digital media, i.e. films, when they became streamable, had a sudden impact on available systemic redundancy.  Prior to high speed internet technology, that allowed the downloading and streaming of movies, one had to attend the local dvd rental shop to obtain movies to watch.  Each dvd rental was a complex product, supporting the staff, their uniforms, rental, insurance, utility bills, packaging etc etc. and as downloading and streaming took over, the cost of those rental outlets was suddenly diminished completely.  The consumer continued, though, to pay reasonably the same amount for each rented film.  The sudden, massive profit ate into the available systemic redundancy in terms of spare money, and the exchange of a complex ecosystem per exchange to an entirely abstract ecosystem led almost certainly, to yet another global economic collapse.

The dvd rental to streaming issue is one example of a broader issue, where technology suddenly and massively reduces the cost to the manufacturer/retailer of some product, and yet the manufacturer/retailer doesn’t pass the saving on to the end consumer.  I consider it to be a type of profiteering, as ultimately, the aim of a healthy and efficient economy, if one accepts the ethical demands of a free market economy, is the supply of goods at the best value for money to the end consumer.

This profiteering continues to occur, and one of the consequences is the sudden increase in inflation.  What is inflation?  The pursuit of increased systemic redundancy.  The market chases any opportunity to arrive at greater levels of systemic redundancy, and does so, naively, by increasing prices.  It does worse things, far worse, to attempt to obtain greater levels of increasing systemic redundancy.

One of these is to lean on weaker agencies and take their systemic redundancy.   This is particularly evident, I suspect, in terms of the first, second and third world national economies in the global economy.  As a first world national economy finds that it has a lack of systemic redundancy, it feeds, vampirically, on second and third world economies, absorbing their systemic redundancy to compensate for its lack of local systemic redundancy.

So, as people stream their movies, they are starving small children to death in impoverished nations around the world.  Dramatic effect aside, this is, I suspect, an unfortunate reality.  At least it is if you can accept that nations steal the redundancy of weaker economies, and that redundancy local to those nations is diminished by abstract products.  I would suggest that it should be a priority of academic research to find evidence of this relationship, in which systemic redundancy of weaker economies is absorbed by stronger economies, and to support some model of global economics where first world economies repay the redundancy that they take, in some fashion.  A circular global economy in this regard might solve the issue of systemic redundancy, where those at the ‘top’ of the economy use their spare resources to top up those at the bottom, as we attempt to achieve greater economic parity between the world’s nations.

There are other forms of structural organisation that impact negatively on the health of an economy, by diminishing systemic redundancy.   One of these is the way in which the profit from some enterprise is distributed.  When it is concentrated in one place, it is a point source of influence, which given that the economy is a complex thing, means that there are many consequences of the concentration of that resource, both distal and proximal, seen and unseen, predictable and unpredictable.  In effect it is an ‘abstract product’, with no complex ecosystem simply because it is concentrated in only a few hands.  To describe the opposite, the ‘complex product’ equivalent in this situation, I will supply an example of what I mean.

I live on the island of Jersey, famous for its milk, potatoes, and financial services industry or ‘tax haven’ as it is often called.  As a dominion of Britain, with a relationship stretching back over a thousand years, and with English as the language, after the second world war, a tourism industry that in Jersey had existed since the 17th century, began to boom, as British people looked to find a holiday in post war Europe that could give them a taste of being overseas without the cost.  By the 1960s, Jersey, all ten by five miles of it, had a booming finance industry, mostly supplied by package tours, so a large amount of visitors, each with only a small amount of money to spend, meant that by the early 1970s, the population of Jersey, which had hovered around 40,000 for most of its history, had increased to 60,000, reaching over 80,000 in the 1980s, the larger percentage of whom supported the tourism industry.

At the height of the season, Jersey airport was the second busiest airport in the world in the mid 70s, second only to Los Angeles, with a flight landing every minute and a half, and every tourist that arrived could be considered an export product, as they brought money into the island with them.   The total value of that export was divided up across all the different hotels, guest houses, cafe’s, restaurants, attractions, coach tours etc etc, and so its impact on the systemic redundancy of the island was gradual, that state of bliss in an economy, no sudden moves.

Then, unfortunately for island life, the tourist industry began to diminish in size.  This was partly due to the availability of cheap package tours to the far more exotic destinations of Spain and Italy, with the nail in the coffin being the establishment of holiday options such as Easyjet.  At the same time, the locals began to gain better paid employment in the finance industry, which had begun to appear in the late 1960s, and grew steadily throughout the 70s and 80s.  It brought a very different type of wealth, and what resulted was a small elite of super wealthy, and a small but significant amount of employees of the finance industry that were paid greater amounts than their peers in the community, setting the standard of success in a place that left others chasing an unrealistic and unattainable goal.  Along with the transfer of power in the political realm from hoteliers and other hospitality management with their experience with people and their goal of creating the good life at a reasonable value, to the budget oriented members of the finance industry, who waste money on a huge scale, used to greater levels of variance, life became very different.  It literally moved from the slow good life, to a sort of rushed attempt to compete in some manner, the populace mirroring the drive of its defining industry.

The socio-economic impact aside, the island’s imports changed from one that was distributed across many different agencies in the economy, in a blanket effect, to the concentrated, focused impact of financial packages, sold to overseas investors.

So, when the exchange of currency is distributed across many agents in an economy, a far healthier consequence occurs in comparison to the relative instability caused by a similar amount of currency, destined to arrive in the same pockets, being focused in a single place, and then distributed via local purchases of goods and services.

In any case, I suggest that the impact of those different forms of exchange, small amounts across many agents vs large amounts across few agents, is best thought of in terms of their impact on type and availability of systemic redundancy.

Another, important, example, is that of the adoption of the single currency in Europe.  Prior to the single currency, Europe had 28 different currencies, and each of those currencies had a certain percentage amount of systemic redundancy, an amount that is roughly similar, I suggest, as its size is a function of the ‘health’ of the economy.  In adopting the single currency, Europe swapped 28 times that percentage, for one single amount.  The consequence was that Europe had 1/28 of the size of systemic redundancy with which to describe its needs.  This wasn’t its only complex economic issue, either.  If one considers that prior to the single currency there were 28 different currencies describing its transactions, and afterwards its transactions were described by one currency, it has far less resolution as an economic mechanism than it had when it was an economic federation with many currencies.  Imagine a picture drawn by its economic mechanism that describes its transactions.  Imagine that picture drawn with 28 different pixels vs that same picture drawn with one pixel.  The European union suddenly had a far lower resolution, far less power, in the systemic sense, in comparison to the federation of autonomous states, and national currencies that was the EEC.  

With no internal exchange mechanism to bring the European nations to economic parity, and with the fact that these are nations that have a long history of war, it seems unlikely that Europe will survive without major war at some point.  As I discuss in greater detail below, keep in mind that Europe’s wealthier nations will feed, vampirically, off the systemic redundancy of the poorer nations, the nearest source for them to feed, and eventually those poorer nations will begin to derive ‘answers’ as to why they are still poor, amidst the types of circumstance that accompany poverty and the brittle state of economic existence that accompanies a permanently diminished amount of local systemic redundancy, ie the rise of right wing extremism, civil unrest etc.

It was far healthier as the federation that it was as the EEC, than it will be as a united, single economic unit.  Perhaps after a millennia of working successfully together as a federation, a single identity, with a single currency, might work.  Furthermore, of the reasons that I have heard quoted for the acceptance of the need for unity, most resolve around the amount of ‘red tape’ that existed in the EEC.  However, the EU was formed when our fastest method of communication was a facsimile machine, and the advent of modern forms of technology, will certainly have negated that amount of red tape, and the time it takes to process it.  I guess that is why other economic units, such as ASEAN, maintain their form as a federation of states.  Note though, that the recent economic hiatus due to Covid19 may well have increased the amount of systemic redundancy that the EU economy has available to it.

It might be possible to circumvent the issues presented here.  Let’s suggest that the goal is that each nation in Europe maintains its own currency, so as to allow an exchange mechanism to be used to bring nations towards economic parity, and so that the economic resolution, and redundancy, and other features of robust, sustainable economics can be acquired.  It should be possible for each person to have a digital card, or phone app, or even for units of currency, as cash, that are electronic, and that has its value represented as the single currency, Euros, whilst at the same time, maintaining that value in its local, national currency, automatically translated from the base currency to Euros.  This would allow residents of Europe to buy and sell goods, whilst the goods themselves can be priced according to a central price repository.  The card contacts the repository when purchasing to establish the price according to the location of the individual.

Whenever an exchange mechanism is concerned, smuggling is a serious issue, and so whatever technology is used must be designed to minimise the potential.  Clear public education as to the point of the internal exchange mechanism should accompany the initiative.  I wonder if it might be of use to have three units of currency translated by the card, Euros, the national currency, and a regional one, so that the differential between one border and its opposite is gradual, with perhaps no real obviously discernible difference between the price in national currency.  In general, a system with high granularity offers greater levels of redundancy, greater resolution of description of its current state and of its needs, greater robustness and is thus more sustainable.

Cash is perhaps the best example of a system, in this regard.  If one naively considers a system of exchange prior to cash, one is faced with the type of problems that accompany the situation where one might wish to exchange 10 sacks of grain for a cow.  The sacks of grain have to be carried, the cow can be walked.  But if I wish to have the facility to purchase a cow, then I need, potentially, to carry around with me 10 sacks of grain, assuming my wealth is derived from growing grain.  Ignoring the promissory notes that precede the introduction of cash, one can imagine a society that creates a store room, where the people check in their goods, in exchange for credit recorded in that store room, and that credit allows them to check out goods.  The individuals that oversee the store room become the gatekeeper to the credit, and this allows the potential for corruption to occur.   But there exists a system of accounting that can account for all the goods, potentially, in the system.  The introduction of cash means that that system of accounting is still effectively present, but in a distributed fashion, where the problem of some central gatekeeper is effectively dispelled as every person with cash is their own gatekeeper.  Money is perhaps the most perfect system that humans have ever created, as it mirrors almost directly the problem domain and in a manner in which power, in comparison to some centralised storeroom, is diffused, so it has high granularity (the higher it is the healthier it is), and a high level of resolution to describe the issue at hand.  Cash, therefore, is an example of a robust and thus sustainable system.  This entire paragraph may seem like a redundancy in itself, as it is rather stating the obvious, but in the same breath as describing the potential that an electronic card can have, as I did in the previous paragraph, I want to counter the suggestion that replacing cash with some perfectly accountable system of currency is a good idea.  It should be obvious why that might be the case, as it revolves around the suggestion that unaccountable cash introduces to an economy an extremely high level of redundancy.  Remove that redundancy with the aim of introducing some form of accountability and you immediately achieve a situation where the currency becomes 100 percent efficient, potentially, in terms of the resolution of its capacity to describe the domain, and 100 percent efficiency is an extremely unhealthy situation.  It leaves 0 percent of redundancy available, and moves cash back towards that situation where it is little more than a system of credit centrally audited by a modern form of ‘storeroom’.  If that cash is not accountable, but is able to adjust the value of its exchange in some incremental fashion according to a dynamically allocating central exchange mechanism that tracks the regional prices of goods  then the capacity for that currency to function toward bringing about parity of economic standing between different regions, whilst not either limiting freedoms or reducing systemic redundancy is achievable.

This leads me to the next point, which is to suggest that a managed economy, as traditionally conceived, is an entirely unhealthy system.  The introduction of controls on any sector of the economy is a point source influence that can have dramatic, unobservable distal and proximal consequences that may well be entirely unhealthy.  From the point of view of the complex system theorist as I have described it here, the free market economy regulated only by endogenous and dynamic macro forces, such as competition, or ethically by the laws that constrain not the economy but the individual, is the only form of system that can function in a robust and sustainable fashion.  I am aware that this statement means that my conception is allied with ‘neoliberalism’, but unfortunately, it is the case that if one can regulate a system successfully, then it is not a complex system.  So regulation of the economy attempts to constrain a complex system into a non complex form.  This might present a problem for those who wish to defend the poorer members of the community though the introduction of rent controls, perhaps, but it can be suggested, I think, that the only way to healthily regulate a complex system is to regulate all of its parts simultaneously.  If one wishes to introduce rent controls to some sector of the market, then one should perhaps adjust all rents simultaneously.  What I think emerges from this simple example is that if a system has sufficient redundancy, it can absorb the turbulence that is consequent to any form of intervention.

Currently, systemic redundancy, despite being probably the single greatest predictor of economic health, is not generally considered.  Instead the glib term ‘growth’ is bandied about, as though economic growth is a sign of economic health.  However, as soon as one considers the metaphorical representations of what ‘growth’ is, one has to reassess any association it might have with ‘health’.   Imperialist invasion is growth.  Colonialism is growth.   Imagine a sphere that is the planet, and a translucent sphere encapsulating it that describes the economy.  When both spheres are equivalent in size, let’s say, we are at 100% efficiency (not necessarily the healthiest of states, as I describe below).  What does growth lead to?

Well, until we reach other planets, the only substantial source of growth is natural resources, so mining, forestry, etc.  I am trying to illustrate that the only way to support growth is by eating into the natural resources, and that is probably why it is popular as a term, as mining interests, forestry associations etc are already very powerful.  But as we are learning, to continue eating those natural resources, is a fool’s errand, and one that is likely to lead to a greatly impoverished existence for our near descendants.  Britain cut down all of its trees in pursuit of expanding its empire, losing its diversity of wildlife in the process, so it is difficult as a Briton to criticise nations that are currently exploiting their natural resources, without saying at some level, ‘don’t do as I do, do as I say’, not something that is likely to be appreciated, particularly.  Currently, the IMF compares economies in terms of their ‘growth’, but as I point out, growth is far more manageable when there is a large availability of natural resources.  So, to compare Britain, with France, Germany or any of the other economies of larger nations is not just unfair, it is damaging, as a smaller nation, with less natural resources will almost certainly collapse in the process of attempting to maintain continuous growth.  Britain is currently reactivating its coal mines, in order to achieve growth, a decidedly unhealthy thing to do given the ecological state of the planet, but what choice does it have, if it is expected to maintain some level of ‘growth’?

So, the pursuit of growth, and the expectation of growth, is therefore bad.  Pursuit of sufficient systemic redundancy is to be preferred, stability over expansion, but this might tax the brains of our currently wealthy ‘capitalists’.  Better the devil you know, suggests the idiom, but this status quo strategy leaves the economy in a state where it continues in its consumption of resources following a precedent set when the industrial revolution was in full swing, and when Britain had natural resources via its colonial relationships.

As I point out on page 1, the maintenance of the economic status quo is the choice of the powerful when their power is derived in any measure from wealth.  So radical change is unlikely to occur.  And it is probably a good thing, too, as sudden, radical change is like that point source of influence that I described in reference to the economy of Jersey.  It has distal and proximal, not necessarily visible consequences, where wealth suddenly changing hands can best be represented in terms of the economy as a complex, dynamic system experiencing a state of extreme turbulence, not a good thing.

Growth, though, can be described as an economic state in which the potential for redundancy is increased.   Inflation, particularly that type which is plaguing Britain currently, may well be the state of an economy chasing increased levels of redundancy, the source of growth (European membership) having been removed.  This is to be expected, perhaps, but  European membership with the free movement of labour led to unsupportable growth, and greatly reduced employee bargaining power, something that has returned concurrently with the high inflation, a difficult and potentially unresolvable experience.  One possible consequence of unrestrained inflation, the devaluation of currency through the introduction of extra money into the economy, is a manner of introducing a greater level of systemic redundancy.  To use growth as a measure of economic performance is not healthy (at least where there are no redundant natural resources), but what of other standard methods of assessing economic success?

Efficiency is one of these, but an efficient system, which is something that can be readily realised with the types of technological resources that we have available to us, is a system with no redundancy, at least under a classical definition of efficiency, which is a system that is not robust to changing circumstances etc.  A system running lean, which has no redundancy, cannot tolerate variance, so is brittle, and prone to collapse.

This is a phenomenon that may be evident when one examines the consequences of the welfare state.  In the welfare state, no member of that society has to worry about their health or the health or wellbeing of their loved ones.  This removes such a phenomenal ‘wolf at the door’ that each individual has a far greater level of cognitive redundancy than they otherwise would have.  The consequence is that the society, as a whole, moves up one level on Maslow’s hierarchy of self actualisation.  When one examines Britain, in general, one can see that the aesthetic level of expression is the norm, there is no rubbish on the streets, even dogs are regulated, prevented from leaving defecation in the street.

The aesthetic level of expression is an emerging phenomena, and one that is being partially disguised by the high levels of inflation, and a consequent lack of resources.  As a phenomenon it is only really evident in those generations who have grown with the welfare state present, so those born in the mid 1960s onwards are the first generations that have never faced that ‘wolf at the door’ that is the fear of unemployment or ill health.

America, where there is no welfare state, has gangs and gun crime, a consequence of the cognitive evolutionary prerogative that accompanies the constantly immediate fear of ill health for themselves or their loved ones.  British people do not live with that pressure, and do not have a proliferation of gangs, or violent crime, outside of the recreational drug market, in which vendors have no recourse to legal methods of recuperating owed monies.   There was a brief period, in the 1970s, in which gangs of Mods, Skinheads, and Punks became present, which I suggest is a consequence of the trauma of world war two passing through the society, the gangs being isomorphic with regiments, the post war poverty being a greater influence on the development of individuals than the nascent welfare state at that time.  The NHS is currently being burdened with every form of stress upon its resources, with the laws surrounding tax avoidance having been drawn up on the inauguration of the welfare state, and tax avoidance leaving the NHS seeming like an unworkable financial failure.

Health is a priceless commodity, and so privatised health systems bring prices that have no upper limit, leaving the majority unable to afford healthcare, or the insurance necessary to provide that care.  It is that no-upper-limit that is equally appealing to those who don’t care about the suffering they will cause in the pursuit of the large profits.  If the welfare system disappears in the near future the Maslovian advance that it has caused won’t be sufficiently noted, I suspect.  A question arises as to whether or not an economy has a greater level of redundancy when its residents all have a greater level of redundancy.  When each of those residents is not driven to hunt down resources, there are greater levels of resources available, and the economy is healthier, I suggest, but at the same time, the residents of that economy can be said to be less ‘hungry’ for work etc, a derogatory phrase that finds currency amongst those who consider the economy as a competitor on the global stage.  The issue turns, I suppose, on whether you consider the residents of the economy to be ‘resources’ (as an employer of slaves might) that work for an economy, or whether they are tenants that are served by the economy.  America, is an example of the former, where Britain, currently at least, is an example of the latter.

A brief, and perhaps over-simplified examination of America, where the lack of a welfare state means that the residents of that nation’s economy languish at lower levels of Maslow’s hierarchy, is instructive both in terms of its discussion of one facet of redundancy, as well as the way in which the modern American is by-and-large, a modern slave.  Bear with me, as the conclusion is worth considering. 

The modern American economy can trace its roots back to the existence of legal slavery, and the economic ‘players’ at that time, were able to amass large fortunes due to the lack of labour costs, wages etc, that accompanied the use of slavery.  It is only fair to suggest that those ‘players’ went on to become principle movers and shakers in the development, from then, of the modern American economy.  It is likely, I think, that some large part of that wealth, invested heavily in both the steel industry and also in the creation of railways.  This has had later ramifications, and is worth, perhaps, researching, to support as a statement. As the railways began to finish reaching their extent, the modern weapons markets began to establish, with the American Civil war through to the first and second world war.  It is to perhaps to go out on a limb, without, research, to suggest this, and perhaps research should be conducted in order to demonstrate the possibility, but I suspect that that agency, or set of agencies, properly, that moved their wealth from businesses that use slaves, to the steel industry and railways, then moved their wealth, still from steel, towards weapons production.  

Whether or not this bears any resemblance to reality is a presently unresearched possibility.  If it is the case, though, then that power that is at the top of the economic hierarchy may have had persistent attitudes towards employment that have left, via their influence, the American people as little more than slaves, in comparison to those nations that have a tax funded welfare system.  In any case, I suggest that the modern American economy has developed with such a powerful relationship with regard to the steel industry, for such a long time, that it has settled (perhaps ‘stabilised’) into a situation where when through whatever reason, the available economic redundancy is reduced, in order to replenish the available surplus that is the redundancy, the US domestic economy is so linked to the production of steel that war becomes a far more readily available alternative.  Once again, bear with me.

The people, like people everywhere, more easily enter into a state of psychosis where war is seen as acceptable; when resources begin to become short, an evolutionary consequence of the many repeated environments that we have inhabited where our behaviour has had to take on aggressive features due to some lack of food and water.  However, the American people, without a welfare state to remove that persistent wolf from the door, are far closer to the emergence of that psychosis than they otherwise would be.  When the domestic economy loses its available redundancy, the fact that the US economy has emerged into modernity in a tightly coupled fashion with that agency that makes profit (and therefore increases domestic available redundancy) by selling steel to itself, and in hand with the potential for psychosis that is experienced by the American people, the domestic economy starts to recover when weapons sales increase, and so war properly keeps the people happy.

I mentioned in the opening paragraph of this essay that there is a tight coupling between the complex system that is the human, aggregated across all humans that interface with an economy, and that complex system that is the economy itself, and this is one clear example, I suggest.  The economy, as the dominant power in that relationship, steals the redundancy from the people, just as it steals redundancy from other, weaker economies.  And a person without redundancy, at the neural level, is a person who is more easily susceptible to exogenous cues, and the type of psychosis that I mention above, aggregated across all people.

Humans are always experiencing a psychosis.  Normality is simply a psychosis that we prefer to inhabit.  Under this interpretation, a psychosis can be considered as a set of attentional expectancies that influence subconscious thought and overt behaviours.  When a person has healthy cognitive redundancy, they have greater freedom to assert themselves endogenously, in a self willed fashion.  When they have an insufficient amount of cognitive redundancy, they are less able to resist exogenous cues, and as a consequence are more likely to adopt behavioural styles and strategies that ease their passage through the day.  

This is why, I suggest, that American life, at least as has been reported to me by my limited amount of contact with Americans, seems to involve a proliferation of gangs, and perhaps is why gun crime is so manifest.  Bill Hicks blames the availability of guns for all the gun crime, and this seems entirely likely, but I suggest that gun crime is at least in part consequent to the types of psychosis that are induced in the populace due to the lack of a welfare state.

More profoundly, perhaps, for the nation that claims to be an exemplar of democratic freedom, is the allegation that without a welfare system, the consequent lack of cognitive redundancy at the individual level, and the maintenance of the people within that lower level of Maslow’s hierarchy, at the aggregated level, leaves the people elevated in their tendency to be prey to biases on their democratic choice.  Without an adequate welfare system, and by that I mean both income support and free healthcare, the individual does not have a sufficient level of cognitive redundancy to have freedom of democratic choice.  With the influential wealth in America having acquired via legacy generation to generation, the attitudes of those who employ slaves, and with a populace that have no real democratic freedom at a cognitive level, it is no wonder that America is experiencing such a turgid, mercurial and somewhat fatalistic social climate.

In the light of the suggestion that large point source influences on a complex system have unintended and uncontrollable proximal and distal consequences, and that the safest way of transferring wealth is through a large number of distributed smaller amounts, one can appreciate that our current form of global economics is entirely unhealthy.  Imagine the economy as a pond and point source influence (i.e. a large and sudden transfer of wealth, in whatever form, profit, purchase, investment etc) as a large pebble.  Our economy is in a continuous state of extreme turbulence, due to the continuous amount of large point sources.  Our economy as a pond is experiencing a turbulence of a continuous stream of large pebbles being chucked into it.   With this in mind, when efficiency, or any other cause of eating up the available systemic redundancy occurs, and the economy becomes brittle, the turbulence of many point source influences is probably causing havoc, and ultimately collapse.  Wealth should be transferred through the smallest, most distributed agency to mitigate this.

Currently, our history leaves us a legacy of a system of economics that can be considered under the rubric of ‘competitive global economics’.  We need to find a way to change, carefully, to a system of ‘collaborative global economics’.  That best of all possible worlds is one in which we work together as a planet to bring all nations to economic parity, to achieve robust parity of quality of life for all its inhabitants.  It may be the case that the possibility of war will bring us that collaborative state.

Recently, China discovered helium 3 in deposits brought back from the moon, is planning a moon base, and will probably be mining on the moon[^2].  For different reasons, apparently, the USA has been making war-like noises in the general direction of China, but the potential loss of exclusive ownership of the moon may be one of the pressures causing this.  One is forced to ask, who owns the moon?  Is it America, who were the first to have planted their flag?  What about Mars?  Who owns the mining rights?  Nations?  Corporations?  I suggest that until all of the people of planet Earth own all of the natural resources of planet Earth, we will not be able to solve the dilemma of other planet ownership, at least not peacefully, and war is likely to be devastating.

A global power grid, to allow solar power in the desert, geothermal power in volcanic regions, tidal power in channels, etc, should be established, to cement the move towards a collaborative global economy.

The business of maintaining economic health, then, is the business of maintaining high levels of redundant resources, in terms of assets, structural organisation and process, at least where the economy is characterised as a thing that serves its inhabitants, and not the other way around, an all too common consequence of the legacy of history.
